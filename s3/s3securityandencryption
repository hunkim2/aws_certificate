Securing your buckets
    -By default, all newly created buckets are PRIVATE
    -You can setup access control control to your buckets using;
        =Bucket Policies
            ==Are bucket wide, so permissions are applied to the entire bucket
        =Access Control Lists
            ==Can drill down to specific objects inside the bucket
    -S3 Buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket.
