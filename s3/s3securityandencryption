SECURING YOUR BUCKETS:
    -By default, all newly created buckets are PRIVATE
    -You can setup access control control to your buckets using;
        =Bucket Policies
            ==Are bucket wide, so permissions are applied to the entire bucket
        =Access Control Lists
            ==Can drill down to specific objects inside the bucket
    -S3 Buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket.

ENCRYPTION:
    -In Transit:
        =To and from your bucket 
            ==SSL/TLS (using HTTPS)
    -At Rest:
        =Server Side Encryption:
            ==S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3
            ==AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS
            ==Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys -SSE-C
        =Client Side Encryption:
            ==Encrypt it on the client side before you send it away.
