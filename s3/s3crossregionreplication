Replication Rule:
    You can either replicate the entire bucket or "prefixes"/sub-directories

Replication will not occur unless an update/newest Version

AWS CLI:

`aws s3 ls`: lists out your s3 buckets
`aws s3 cp --recursive s3://[name of bucket to copy] s3://[name of bucket destination of copy]`: copies bucket recursively to another bucket can be used
for cross region replication.

EXAM TIPS:

    -Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets
    -Regions must be unique
    -Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically. All subsequent updated files will be replicated automatically.
    -You cannot replicate to multiple buckets or use daisy chaining (at this time)
    -Delete markers are replicated (markers as in, they will be shown to be "ready to be deleted")
    -Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated
    -Under what Cross Region Replication is at a high level.
