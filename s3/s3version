If versions is activated:
    -It will show the available versions of an uploaded object
    -Making changes in video files that are large and tracking version it would take more funding

Versioning also includes MFA (multi-factoring authentication)
    Keeps these values using two forms of authentication:
        -Your secuirty credentails
        -The concatenation of a valid serial number, a space, and the six-digit code displayed on an approved authentication device
    Adds additional authentication for these following operations:
        -Change the versioning state of your bucket
        -Permanently delete an object version

EXAM TIPS:
    -Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
    -Great backup tool
    -Once enabled, Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended
    -Integrates with Lifecycle Rules
    -Versioning's MFA(multi-factor authentication) capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used
    to provide an additional layer of security
