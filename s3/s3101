S3 = Simple Storage Servics
S3 is a safe place to store your files.

It is Object based storage.
-Object: things like videos and photos, PDFs, word documents or "flat files"
-Designed to handle failure
-Would not store an operating system or a database: you would do this on a block system

The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.

-S3 is object based and allows you to upload files.
-Files can be from 0 bytes to 5TB
-There is unlimited storage
-Files are stored in buckets (basically a directory)
-Is a universal namespace, aka you cannot use those names that already been claimed.
-Understand the format of bucket names
-When you upload a file to S3 you will receive a HTTP 200 code if they upload was successful


DATA CONSISTENCY MODEL FOR S3

-Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
    =PUT versus POST
        ==e.i. Use PUT when dealing with particular question
        ==e.i. Use POST when dealing with a list of questions
-Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
    =Basically means that Read and Write will be instanteneous however Updating or Deleting an object
    will take some time and will not be instant
