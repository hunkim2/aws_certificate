S3 = Simple Storage Servics
S3 is a safe place to store your files.

It is Object based storage.
-Object: things like videos and photos, PDFs, word documents or "flat files"
-Designed to handle failure
-Would not store an operating system or a database: you would do this on a block system

The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.

-S3 is object based and allows you to upload files.
-Files can be from 0 bytes to 5TB
-There is unlimited storage
-Files are stored in buckets (basically a directory)
-Is a universal namespace, aka you cannot use those names that already been claimed.
-Understand the format of bucket names
-When you upload a file to S3 you will receive a HTTP 200 code if they upload was successful


DATA CONSISTENCY MODEL FOR S3

-Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
    =PUT versus POST
        ==e.i. Use PUT when dealing with particular question
        ==e.i. Use POST when dealing with a list of questions
-Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
    =Basically means that Read and Write will be instanteneous however Updating or Deleting an object
    will take some time and will not be instant

-S3 is Object based and consist of the following
    1. Key (This is simply the name of the object)
    2. Value (This is simply the data and is made up of a sequence of bytes)
    3. Version ID (Important for versioning)
    4. Metadata (Data about the data you are storing)
    5. Subresources
        -Access Control Lists: who can access this object, fine grain permissions
        -Torrent: BitTorrent Protocal

-Amazon guarantees 99.999999999% durability for S3 information (11x9's)
-Tiered Storage Available
-Lifecycle Management
    =Cycle certain data based on time
-Versioning 
-Encryption
-Secure your data using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies



STORAGE TIERS/CLASSES
-Stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently
-IA(Infrequently Accessed): For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are
charged a retrieval fee.
    =Data that is accumulated but not frequently accessed but is readily available
    =Can be used for when getting employee payroll at the end of the year
-Reduced Redudancy Storage: Designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year.
    =Can be used when files can be easily replaced because the durability is not 11x9's
-Glacier: Very cheap, but used for archival only. It takes 3 - 5 hours to restore from Glacier.

In the exam it will clearly ask what is the best practice for the most monetarily sound practice for server architecture.


CHARGED FOR?
-Storage 
-Requests 
-Storage Management Pricing
    =Associates different tags such as HR or Development departments
-Data Transfer Pricing (replication to another region)
-Transfer Acceleration
    =enables fast, easy and secure transfers of files over long distances between end users and S3 bucket.
    =Takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon
    S3 over an optimized network path

Exam Tips for S3 101:

-Remember that S3 is Object based e.i. allows you to upload files.
    =Don't use it for installing operating systems or databases, the performance will be shit.
-Files can be from 0 Btyes to 5 5TB
-There is unlimited storage
-Files are stored in Buckets(aka folder)
-S3 is a universal namespace
-example URL: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
-Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
-Eventual consistency for overwite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
-S3 Storage Classes/Tiers:
    =S3
    =IA
    =Reduced Redundancy Storage
    =Glacier
-Remember the core fundamentals of an S3 object
    =Key (name of file)
    =Value (data)
    =Versions ID
    =Meta data
    =Subresources (Access Control Lists, and Torrent)
    =Read S3 FAQ before taking the exam.

Exam Tips S3 Bucket:

-Buckets are a universal name space
-Upload an object to S3 receive a HTTP 200 code
-Encryption
    =Client Side Encryption
    =Server Side Encryption
        -Server side encryption with Amazon S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)
        -Server side encryption with KMS (SSE-KMS)
        -Server side encryption with Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C)
    =Control access to buckets using either a bucket ACL or using Bucket Policies
    =By default buckets are private and all objects stored inside them are private
